~ ~ ~ Compiling

1: Double-click MAFFia.pbproj to open Project Builder.

2: Press the "Build" button in the top left.

3: Ignore the 6 errors encountered while compiling "loading.c". They don't seem to cause problems. If anyone works out how to stop them, I'd be interested.

4: Enjoy!


~ ~ ~ Notes on the code

…all I can say, at the moment, is "look out". It's messy, there are whole sections that almost entirely duplicate each other, a couple of bits may require some head-scratching to work out… Sorry. Watch out for subtly-misleading function names too.

Check back at iDevGames.com for more recent versions of this source code, possibly with some of the above problems slightly alleviated.
